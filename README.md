This repository contains source code used to in making [Morphocular](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu7Zwf4X_OQ-TEnou0zdyRA) videos. You can find the code for each project in the `projects/` directory.

The animations primarily use the [Morpho](https://github.com/morpho-matters/morpholib) library, so to be able to render the animations, you will need to have Morpho installed. Note that code from older projects may not work on newer versions of Morpho, but each project in this repository carries its own local copy of the library with the version it needs, so as long as you don't remove that local copy, the code should run just fine. However, I still recommend having the latest version of Morpho installed on your system anyway to ensure that the local copies have access to the required dependencies.
